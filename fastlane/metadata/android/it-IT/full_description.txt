Calculator designed just for people in the UK
The fastest and easiest MPG calculator for people using UK gallons
Just two boxes and one button and your done

Now has an added feature a cost tab as long as you know how much a liter costs and how much you spent you can work out how many liters of fuel you put into your car in case you forget like I do. Also the number will be automatically copied over to the first tab to save you remembering.

I looked at the market and couldn't find a MPG calculator that was setup ready for people in the UK so I made this app and it is a simply as I could make it. Its designed to be fast and do what it is meant to do and nothing more or less.
